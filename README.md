Hackroost
========

Here's a micropage that is a link list of youtube channels that host cybersecurity talks. It's built with primarily html and a few neat js things. There are four theme colors to choose from: default (pastel), dark mode (jewel tones), greyscale, and 1337 hacker mode.

How To Submit
===============

Themes
===============

Here's all the themes:
